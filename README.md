**SpecTrust** is a web-based application developed for the quantitative analysis and visualization of isotopic measurement uncertainty. It implements statistically rigorous methods‚Äîincluding bracketing-based Œ¥ (delta) value computation, uncertainty propagation, inverse-variance weighting, and Monte Carlo simulation‚Äîto provide researchers with reproducible, interpretable metrics of analytical precision. The platform supports both manual and batch (CSV-based) data entry and outputs numerical results alongside violin plots and scatter plots for comparative uncertainty assessment. Spec-Trust is designed to enhance transparency and consistency in isotopic data evaluation workflows.

## Key features

### Automated Delta and Uncertainty Calculations
- Calculates Œ¥ values using bracketing method according to the following equation
$$\delta_s (\permil) = \left[ \frac {\left( \frac{^{82}\text{Se}}{^{78}\text{Se}} \right)_s} {\frac{1}{2} \left( \left( \frac{^{82}\text{Se}}{^{78}\text{Se}} \right)_{b_1} + \left( \frac{^{82}\text{Se}}{^{78}\text{Se}} \right)_{b_2} \right)} - 1 \right] \times 1000$$
Where:
  - $\left( \frac{^{82}\text{Se}}{^{78}\text{Se}} \right)_s$ is the measured isotope ratio of the sample
  - $\left( \frac{^{82}\text{Se}}{^{78}\text{Se}} \right)_{b_1}$ and $\left( \frac{^{82}\text{Se}}{^{78}\text{Se}} \right)_{b_2}$ are the measured isotope ratios of the two bracketing standards
  
  The result is multiplied by 1000 to express the deviation in parts per thousand (‚Ä∞).


- Computes propagated standard error SE(Œ¥) using

    $$
    SD_\delta \approx 10^3 \cdot \left| \frac{2 \cdot \mu_s}{\mu_{b_1} + \mu_{b_2}} \right| \cdot \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\sigma_s}{\mu_s} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{ \sqrt{\sigma_{b_1}^2 + \sigma_{b_2}^2} }{ \mu_{b_1} + \mu_{b_2} } \right)^2 }
    $$
    Where:
    - $ \mu_{s} $ is the measured sample ratio
    - $ \mu_{b1}$, $ \mu_{b2} $ are the ratios of the bracketing standards
    - $ \sigma_{s} $, $ \sigma_{b1} $, $ \sigma_{b2} $ are their corresponding standard errors

### Statistical validation
**Shapiro‚ÄìWilk** test is applied to assess whether the distribution of Œ¥ values can be considered normally distributed. This evaluation supports the underlying statistical assumptions required for parametric analyses and model-based inference. The null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) assumes normality (Œî ‚àº ùí©), while the alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ) suggests otherwise. A sufficiently high p-value indicates that Œ¥ values do not significantly deviate from a normal distribution.

### Uncertainty computation

The application implements three rigorous statistical approaches to summarize overall uncertainty in Œ¥ values:
    
- **Standard Deviation of Œ¥** 

    A classic statistical measure that represents the spread of Œ¥ values around their mean. It captures the random variation inherent in repeated measurements without taking individual uncertainties into account.
- **Inverse-œÉ Weighted Mean**

  A precision-weighted average of Œ¥ values, where measurements with smaller standard errors contribute more heavily. This method yields a more robust central estimate when individual uncertainties vary substantially.
- **Monte Carlo Simulated Uncertainty**

  An empirical method that introduces simulated random noise based on each measurement‚Äôs standard error to generate synthetic Œ¥ datasets. The average spread of these datasets provides a realistic estimate of total uncertainty.

### Uncertainty visualization

- **Half violin plot** provides a visual representation of the distribution and spread of Œ¥ values and their associated uncertainties. Each violin is centered on a measurement and shaped according to a normal distribution defined by its Œ¥ and SE(Œ¥). Summary uncertainty estimates (SD, Inverse Sigma, MC) are also plotted as color-coded violins for comparative purposes.

- **Scatter plot with error bars** displays Œ¥ values with vertical lines representing ¬± SE(Œ¥). This plot allows users to assess consistency across measurements, identify outliers, and visually compare replicate data.
